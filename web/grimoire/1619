General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE GNOME EXPERIMENTS

While the logic driving the experiments was somewhat convoluted, the gnomes used
amazing powers of research in achieving their goals.  They determined that if
The World was a dangerous place, elves and dwarves would need to worry about
defense more, and offense less.  Less offense would translate into a smaller
(or hopefully non-existent) war.  In time, the war might be forgotten and the
two races might come to cooperate against the new challenges.
 
Their initial experiments caused them to unknowingly duplicate the Faerie's
research that had led to the creation of the dwarves and later the gnomes
themselves.  They set about to create a new race or group of races whose main
purpose was to bring about chaos and unleash misery.  The proceedings of these
experiments are detailed in a separate volume that they not clutter these
discussions (cf. Discourse on the Gnome Experiments and Treatise on Life
Creation - Anilstathis).

From these experiments, gnomes learned the focus and control of magical
energies necessary to achieve their ends.  In underground labs they mingled
thaumaturgy with simple rodents and grew their first race, the orcs.  From
there, they proceeded to goblins, kobolds and hobgoblins.  Larger experiments
resulted in the trolls and ogres.  And the ultimate experiment started with
a lizard as the base, and produced basilisk and finally the first small
dragons.  All were released upon The World, in order to see which would thrive.
