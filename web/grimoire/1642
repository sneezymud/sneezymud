General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE SPREAD OF TEACHINGS

The spread of the teachings took three generations to bring about from
one end of civilization to the other, fortunately Logrus and Galek were
virtually immortal as Faeries.  Even though the disciples might die, the
teacher was always there.  Logrus and Galek each spent much time
amongst the nonhumans indirectly offering them a return to the Faerie
realm, but their message achieved its greatest success amongst the
humans, to the chagrin of both Faeries.

As the generations passed, the teachings became institutions in themselves.
Ultimately, the ancient hatreds Logrus had been praying upon became less
a concern then the brewing conflict caused by the competing viewpoints.
The Cult had long ago taken hold in neighboring regions separated by the
Black Age, and with a common ground between the two groups established, 
it was only a matter of time before the barriers would drop.  Where the 
Cult did not hold sway, Galek's teachings preached cooperation so these
barriers dropped too, only to be replaced by defenses against the threat
the opposing philosophy presented.  It was only a matter of time before it
would induce conflict.
