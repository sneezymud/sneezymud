expected to respect the coder's authority over the code files.

LOW Staff : The Senior LOW is thought to be the chief point of contact for the
LOW Staff.  While not technically a manager/supervisor position; the "vision"
of the Senior LOW is penultimate.

Builders : The Senior LOW is charged with being the guardian of the builders,
promoting builders as the succeed, and demoting them if they fail.  The
Senior LOW is granted almost complete autonomy where builders are concerned.
The Senior LOW is expected to insure that builders are adequately trained
and kept informed of relevant news.

MudAdmin : The Senior LOW receive direction for major changes to the tiny files from
   MudAdmin, and provide to them status reports as necessary.
   MudAdmin is expected to identify those areas that are authorized for
   overhaul, but it remains the Senior LOW's authority to volunteer to undertake the
   project(s) that the LOW Staff sees fit.
