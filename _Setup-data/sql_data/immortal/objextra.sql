The witchdoctor assures me that if I keep a personal record of my thoughts and feelings that it\'ll curb the desire to hurl random slaves into the hole.  We\'ll see...<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 4: \r\n<y>   I only killed 3 people today.  Maybe this works?<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 5:\r\n<y>   2 dead, 1 permanently disabled.  Not bad!<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 6:\r\n<y>   Update to entry 5.  The disabled worker died and was sent to the pit.  Bummer.<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 7:\r\n<y>   Having bowel problems again.  I\'m going to kill that damn clerk!<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 8:\r\n<y>   The dig process is going too slow.  I don\'t know how much longer I can hold on.  It feels like we\'ve been here forever!  I can\'t believe I was exiled.  A fine troll of my standing deserves far better than this.  She told me she was 18!<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 9:\r\n<y>   I\'ve been \"told\" that if I find \"it\" I can return home with a heroes welcome.  We\'re finding many things of real value but the chest still eludes us.  I don\'t know if we\'ll ever find it again.  That damn angry bastard of a foreman insists it was stolen but I think it sank during the move.  The damn water is everywhere and getting to the ultimate prize, if it even exists, looks damn near impossible.  Stupid vibrations, unbreakable stone, must I continue.  We should just kill it, damn the losses! Oh my god my hand hurts from all this writing!  Wow, I say damn a lot!  Weird.<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 10:\r\n<y>   Today was a really bad.  I killed 13 workers, 2 guards and 3 of those repulsive inbred berg whores.  I was in the dig site and dropped the...well, I either dropped it or it was stolen from me.  If losing the chest wasn\'t enough, losing this as well was just too much for me to handle in one day. I interrogated each of the workers but through their wimpy shrieks and shrill cries for help, I lost my patience and just started throwing them into the hole.  It made me feel better but now I need to get more workers.  I\'m sick of this journal.<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 11:\r\n<y>   More workers arrived today.  I welcomed them by throwing one into the hole.  Suckers.<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 12:\r\n<y>   Some of the staff thought they could take their break on MY observation platform.  Haha!<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 13:\r\n<y>   The platform is the only place I seem to find any solace any more.  I fool myself into thinking it\'s night time and spend my time there, brooding and trying to think positive thoughts.  I like to throw stuff at the workers below.  Sometimes my grief is too much.<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 14:\r\n<y>   I received an anonymous note today.  It basically said that the cuckoo has left the clock for our good Doctor Fusarium and that Commander Aspergillus who I think is doing an outstanding job personally, is a sadistic nut job.  It also said Jalashzach takes himself entirely too seriously but is the only fair and decent member of my staff and interestingly enough, it told me that the Foreman is a...how did they put it...\"A Bloody Thief\".  Last but not least, and most importantly, as the world revolves around me, it said I was an evil prick and that I should consider killing myself upon receipt of this message.  It was signed, The Resistance.  Cute.  Very cute.<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 15:\r\n<y>   More rumors of a Resistance Group are starting to filter up to me.  I will get to the bottom of this.  Only killed 2 people today!  Hooray!  Feeling a little better.<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 16:\r\n<y>   Word came to me today that despite our success in finding (and then losing) some treasures, our progress to find the legendary lore is still too slow.  A report was also delivered to me indicating the damn aquatic dragon actually left his cavern! Apparently a worker tried to escape through the the muck and grime of the sunken tunnels and actually stumbled into his feeding area instead!  Ha Ha, dwarves are so stupid.  Talking to myself is fun.<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 17:\r\n<y>   I miss my family and friends.  I\'m sad.<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 18:\r\n<y>   Supplies keep going missing.  We still haven\'t found the chest.  I have begun to lock my room even when I\'m in it just to be safe.  I gave Fusarium a spare key just in case, as the longer I stay here, the more forgetful I seem to become.  Only the platform at night and this journal bring me peace any more.<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 19:\r\n<y>   I think we\'ll try digging from a new direction soon as the last tunnel they excavated turned out to be a big waste of time.  Stupid workers don\'t even know how to use their tools.  It\'s just stone!  We must find a viable way to get to that chamber.<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 20:<y>\r\n   I privately discussed the idea of a full frontal attack on that bastard aquatic dragon with Aspergillus and Jalashzach.  Despite what the elders at home think, I\'m of the thought that we could kill it and start digging where we need to dig instead of all this circuitous, inane and time consuming work around type stuff.  It might not even be there...although, I will say that the humming and the runes are clear evidence something is there.  I must find it!  Aspergillus was all for it, he supports me...Jalashzach felt it was a futile effort.  Pious prick.  He can take his symbol and shove it as far as I\'m concerned.   There\'s simply just too few of us.  Sigh.  Uh...I\'m writing out that I am sighing??  What the frak is going on with me?<z>\r\n\r\nEntry 21:\r\n<y>   I think we\'re onto something!  Today they...bugger, that walking stink bomb of a clerk and his leaking ass is here for his daily appointment with me.  I\'ll fill in the rest later.  Journals are fun!<z>\r\n'),
