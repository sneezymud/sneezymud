      spec_rooms.h : interface for calling room special procedures

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Special procedures for rooms may be called under five different
  conditions:  by a player command, when the room is first allocated in
  memory, during the room's zone reset, when the room is deallocated
  from memory, and periodically (every PULSE_MOBILE heartbeats -- at
  the time of writing, a little over 7 seconds).  A room's special
  procedure must return "int".  A return value of zero (FALSE) indicates
  that nothing exceptional happened.  A non-zero return value (TRUE)
  indicates that some action needs to be taken (such as ignoring the
  players command).  When in doubt, return FALSE.

  A rooms special procedure must be defined using the following
  parameter list:
                   (Mob **ch, cmdTypeT cmd, char *arg, Room *rp)

  These parameters are defined as follows:
     ch - used when a mob/player triggers the room's special procedure.
          Will contain a pointer to the triggering mob/player.
    cmd - what triggered the procedure to be called.  A number greater
          than zero indicates a player command.  A number less than
          zero indicates something like ROOM_RESET.
    arg - will be non-NULL only when catching a player command.
     rp - a pointer to the room for which the spec_proc was called.
