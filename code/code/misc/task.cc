    Batopr 8-10-96:
  to start a task, do:
  start_task(this, obj, rp, TASK_MEDITATE, arg, 0, in_room, 1, 0, 40);

  obj and rp can be NULL
  arg is probably ""
   
  timeLeft: (the first 0)
    - generally used as a counter of the number of interations of
      CMD_TASK_CONTINUE that have been encountered.
    - can be any (int) value desired 
 
  in_room: (sets ch->task->was_in_room)
    - task should check current room vs this.
      reason: start the task and let my group leader move me around mud.

  status (the 1)
    - a ubyte.
    - some tasks set this to one value in start_task and check in
      CMD_TASK_CONTINUE status.  If its not what it was initted to, do the
      continue code.  at the bottom of CONTINUE, set it to some new value.
      The reason for doing this is that the first call to CMD_TASK_CONTINUE is
      almost instantaneous with when it was started.
    - probably a better way to do this would be by initing timeLeft to 0
      in start_task and incrementing it 1 for each call to CONTINUE.  CONTINUE
      code would only execute if timeLeft > 0.  That would free the status byte
      for use any way we want.

  flags:
    - an int, use depends on the task.

  nextUpdate:
    - NOT WHAT IT SEEMS:  
      start_task() says ch->task->nextUpdate = nextUpdate.
    - calls to CMD_TASK_CONTINUE occur if pulse > ch->task->nextUpdate
    - notice that because pulse is typically big, calls to TASK CONTINUE are
      virtually instantaneous.
    - it is not until the first call to CMD_TASK_CONTINUE that we typically set
      ch->task->nextUpdate = pulse + xxxx
    - this leads to the status trick defined above.
    - SO BASICALLY, THIS VALUE IS WORTHLESS
