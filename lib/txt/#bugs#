Well, as is normal, let's chaulk another thing up that
you CANNOT DO 
while disguised.  Besides interacting with mobs in
most any way, buying 
things, participating in quests, renting, using the
hospitals, etc etc.  
Add to the list that you cannot extinguish yourself
(ie: extinguish me) 
when disguised, and as a result you lose precious eq. 
Is this really a 
bug?  Probably not since the person who originally
coded disguise 
didn't think of these things in the first place. 
Forgive my sarcasm.  I do 
realize that it isn't helping my cause but, really,

Subject: [Bug] Trophy List - Chaos Garrison Dungeon (Shota)
The trophy list seems to only load 8 mobs in this zone, but but trophy indicates that there should be 9.  Hence 8/9 mobs on the trophy list is the best you can do.  It is possible that there is a hidden room/ hidden mob here, however, I have dont my best to scour this zone for the final mob, and been unable to find it.  It may load elsewhere in the game, and I have yet to come across it whereever it might be located.  But it is a rather small, starter type zone that I would not assume to be overly intricate enough to place a mob outside its own zone borders.  If there is some problem, and the last mob is not loading in the game, either have the mob load, remove it (somehow) from the trophy list for the Chaos Garrison Dungeon (perhaps moving it to a newly created "unused mob" section would be easier?)   There are other issues with trophy, certain disabled zones still count for trophy purposes (most notably the numerous chaos plains, etc zones by mithros).  Yet those mobs were once in the game, and there are people who have killed those mobs in this version, so I dont think they should be removed.  However, it would be nice to potentially get to 100% killed in any enabled zones - some of which include trainers, and are artifically inflated with mobs.  I think one zone may also include "testmobs" of all levels, but those mobs get used from time to time at least.  Once of my characters has killed one in helping with some experiment.  Perhaps those should be reclassified or something...  Obviously, this is not a pressing issue, but its something that bothers me - any potential trophy list errors, etc.  When stuck one mob short, and investing way too much time looking for a mob, merely because it doesnt load, and thus cannot be found.  Shopkeepers/noheal mobs are a separate issue - sinec they are in the game, but I at least, havent found a way to get them out to fight them.

Subject: Selling Potions in Shops
Not a big thing, just kind of annoying that i can't change it - i have access to Crossroads of the Arkane (from MS, 6s, 2e) - i can change the price of all scrolls and other potions, but i brewed 10 rusty potions, and i can't change the price on them - they're stuck at 37k.  If this problem cannot be fixed so that i can change the price, please set the price of rusty potions to 22,000 talens or there abouts.  Cheers, Fedaykin

Another problem is giving a mob that loaded leprosy then log off.  After a few hours, the mob's limbs will have fallen off so it cannot fight back.  While the current cleric fixes balanced the class a lot, the disease prayer has not been addressed.  There should be a check against the level of the mob to see whether the disease prayer succeeeds or not, as the other prayers within affliction currently works.

killing mobs and transfering eq
Currently, if someone uses a high level pc to kill a mob that loaded good eq then leave the eq in the corpse for the person's lowbie to loot, the eq disappears because of multiplay.  Clerics have a way around this.  By giving the mob infect then hurting the mob up to near death, clerics can have the mob die from bleeding or infection.  Then the cleric's lowbie pc can come and loot it without this scenario falling under the multiplay code that makes eq disintegrate.

Changes to Hurl- Good job, but one problem:
So I'm fully cool with the addition of command lockout to hurl, but- if you try to hurl a mob that is on the ground, it displays the message 'you can't hurl X when they are on the floor!', which again, is fine except that it still gives you the 2.8 second lockout. Shouldn't do that in this case, since no actual attempt to hurl has been made.  Cheers
