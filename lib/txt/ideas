Subject: [Idea] completing the financial loop
It seems that as shops stock up the market for loot of anything low level comes to a halt and it becomes increasingly difficult to sell the wares.  Quite a lo t of rewards for killing mobs simply arent worth it because the shops have too many of that. It may be a good idea to have mobs purchasing cheap, level relative armor/weapons from stores to keep the cycle moving.  This would also serve to  balance out the mob/player power problems brought on by elimination of rent limits.

Subject: [Idea] Ranger ability - Barracade
In order to effectively use the ranged offense, I suggest that the ranger be able to set up a barricade. It would require he be in a nature square (or perhaps carry wood) and take movement and time. This way, he can shoot at a mob when the mob charges in, it must first hack through the rangers defense, alowing him to loose off a few more arrows Obviously the mob would eventually break down the barrier and attack the ranger, but would be sufficently weakened such that the ranger can then take him out in hand-hand combat  Just an idea.

Subject: [Idea] Smything fun
Hey. Laren has a ton of fun with smythe, but she runs into weird scenarios that don't make sense. What mostly doesn't make sense is that you wield everything! Like, you're going to USE it. :) What would make more sense is to have some special way of holding, specifically for smything.  Obviously, smythers don't always have the ability to wield everything they should be able to smythe. But that doesn't mean they should not be able to smythe it anyways. :) Such as, say, long silver daggers.  I can't hold them, so I can't smythe them. But actual blacksmith types don't have such restrictions because they don't wield the weapons to USE them.  They're just fixing them.   Is there any way to change the way we smythe so we have a special method of holding things specifically for smything?  Obviously, we can't attack using the weapons we're holding to smythe.  It just won't work, just like if a smyther tries to attack holding the weapon she's smything!  Also, it seems there should be some way to smythe heavy things, like suits. If Piggot can do it, why can''t we?  Because we're limited by the ability to use the regular hold.  Maybe it would require a special tool or something to assist us, but that's ok... Smythers use more tools than a hammer. :)  I just very much enjoy fixing people's equipment and weapons, and I've spent a lot of time honing smythe (one of the hardest things to hone), and am disappointed when I can get everything but the suit smythed up to brand new again.  :)  Same with, say, the silver dagger and other things I'm forbidden to hold.  Monogrammed items, for instance.  And, the impressive deikhan weapons.   I don't wish, in any way, to find a back door to being able to WIELD these weapons, but want to fix them. :) Wonder if there's some other way to do this?  It seems logical enough.:)  Thanks! Laren

Subject: [Idea] Statistics
The attribute stats commands lists alot of info : pets owned, blood lost, crits, etc.  If possible, I think it would be helpful to add another sort of stat : grouping vs. solo. List amount of time grouped and amount of time solo (and as percentages of total time),  as well as a breakdown of xp made solo vs grouped, and then the percentage of total xp for each. Deaths should be listed as grouped or solo as well, and xp reductions from death can be subtracted from the proper category.  Not only would the stats be interesting in the abstract, but they might also spur people to group more (as the data will likely show that grouping is quite beneficial).

Subject: [Idea] New Toggle
Much like the toggle for the trophy system that indicates after every kill what your trophy rating against  any particular mob currently is at, I would like a toggle that indicates the amount of xp earned for that kill.  I dont know how possible this is - how fleeing might affect things if a person makes xp but never kills the mob, etc.  Still, its information that I'd like to know, and its a pain to constantly monitor such with repeatedly checking the "score" command.

How about a quest at say level 40 for clerics. The quest would be so that they could bless water to make holy water. Maybe only a little at a time and it takes awhile to do it.
