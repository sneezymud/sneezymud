05-29-24: Prop items are now implemented and available to use in your zonefiles.
          Information about them hasn't been added to the builder books yet.

          They work identically to the E and Z zonefile commands. Just replace
          them with I and J respectively. Prop items load and are equipped on
          mobs **when they spawn**, even when load-on-death is enabled, so they'll
          wear them while wandering their zones.

          Their purpose is to allow making fights more difficult, interesting,
          and dynamic by providing mobs with non-rentable, non-sellable copies
          of weapons and armor that decay a set period of time after being looted.
          The current decay time is set to 8 real life hours, but can easily be
          adjusted by a coder if needed.

          They can also act as a temporary consolation prize when a player wins a
          fight but the mob fails to load the real version of the item on death.

          Mobs with prop items might do more damage, take less damage, cause players
          to damage their weapons when striking the mobs' armor, be protected from
          certain insta-kill crits, and be able to use abilities that require items
          to function which players aren't expecting a mob to use (e.g. backstab or
          stab), etc.

          Trying to load as a prop any item with less than 5 more possible loads
          before reaching its max_exist will fail. Since prop items still count
          towards an item's max_exist, adding enough props of a specific item
          could potentially block the real version from ever loading.

          To use a low max_exist item (e.g. an artifact weapon) as a prop, create a
          copy of the item under a new vnum (and consider adding [prop] to its short
          name), give it a high max_exist, then make sure to only ever load that
          specific version as a prop.

          Example zonefile commands:

          * Load mob 1234 with a max_exist of 1 in room 100
          M 0 1234 1 100

          * If the above mob loads successfully, equip a prop version of item
          * 1000 with a max_exist of 9999 in its right hand
          I 1 1000 9999 18

          * Load locally defined zonefile armor set 1 as prop items with 100%
          * chance per piece and equip them on the above mob
          J 0 1 100

          * Give the mob a 10% chance to load the real version of item 1000
          * on death.
          ? 0 10 0 E
          E 1 1000 9999 18

          * Give the mob a 2% chance per piece to load the locally defined
          * zonefile armor set on death
          Z 0 1 2

          These commands can all coexist on the same mob at the same time.

          Note: there is no prop equivalent of the Y command for loading sets
          defined in the suitset file.
