Special Note:                  As you might have guessed, a smaller group

                               splitting, however it is often advantageous to
                               have a larger number of people. The more people
                               you have, the more the group knows about the

TREASURE HUNT:  Players will be given a riddle that will lead to a treasure
map. The treasure map will depict an area on the mud where the treasure
chest is located. There will be a riddle upon the treasure chest that will
lead to the key needed to open it.  The first team to successfully open the
treasure chest gets the contents.  Approved contestants and groups will
meet at the appointed time in the Mud-Wide Contestant's Lounge in the
area above Grimhaven Center Square unless otherwise posted to the
Tournament/Quest board.
