Advanced Action: flag
---------------------

ex:
<trigger> { "<arguments>";
       <other actions>;
      flag %n;
       <other actions>;
     }

The flag command will make the trigger-mob flag someone with the solo-quest
flag.  This is the same as if a god had done flag <person> solo so see
HELP FLAG for effects of such a flag.

It is advised that you make sure the player understands he is about to be
flagged, effects of the flag (no grouping, following, riding, spells cast on,
etc) and that they acknowledge these facts PRIOR to actually being flagged.
