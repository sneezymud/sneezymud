Chapter 7:  Event Ideas.

All event ideas will be considered.  Please post all such ideas on the
tournament board or <h> mail them to "Fay", the tournament organizer.
All posts will at least get a reply.  If one of your suggested events is
used, you will be rewarded by the gods and get the event named after you.
If it is not used, do not take offense, it may be used in future
tournaments.
