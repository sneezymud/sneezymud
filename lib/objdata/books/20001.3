Chapter 3:  Tournament Zone Events.

All the events described in this book will take place in a special
arena-type zone built specially for the tournament.  It will be connected
to the mud on the day of the tournament and will be easy to get to. These
events are designed to test your mudding skills and not the strengths and
weaknesses of your <h> characters.  In all of these events you will
be playing characters created for you by the gods so that all competitors
will start equal to each other competitor.  These characters will be set
to have certain stats and skills that will help or hinder you in competing
in the events.

These characters will also have colors as names so you can follow signs to
event starting places.  Contestant names will be assigned you and last
minute rule modifications, if any, will be provided on the day of the
tournament.  However, in the meantime and to avoid last minute confusion,
read all information about your events and come prepared to all events.
If you have questions about the events please send questions to Fay or
post them on the board before the day of the tournament.

Most of the events described in this book are designed to test your
mudding skills.  You will have to avoid or hunt others using a variety of
mud skills, spells and weapons.  If you are the prey, the hunters will be
played by either other competitors or gods. If you are the hunter, the
prey will be played by other competitors or gods. Obviously, any prize won
by these created character will be given to the mud character of your
choice.
