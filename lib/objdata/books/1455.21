I got attacked for no reason, what happened?
--------------------------------------------
(Artificial Interactions and Brawls)

Implementor Batopr has taken upon the chore of making mobs behave more
intelligently.  Mobs will react to insulting, aggressive or suspicious
behavior and often as a result will attack preemptively.  Obviously,
if someone puked on you intentionally, this would piss you off, likewise
with mobs.  To a limited degree, they have memories as well.  Just because
it doesn't attack you at the time you upset it doesn't mean that a few
minutes later it won't decide you are some twit that needs to be taught a
lesson.  This sort of AI code continues to get more complex, but is a
leading cause of mobs becoming enraged and going on killing sprees, so
be warned.

Also, any given fight has the possibility of turning into a brawl unexpectedly.
Watching a fight between two creatures may result in the spectator suddenly
being caught up in the battle.  Likewise, fighting a given mob may cause
other creatures in the room to either jump in on one side or the other or
be caught up in it randomly.  Town and cityguards have the tendency to call for
assistance from a distance - be careful if taking on the cops.
