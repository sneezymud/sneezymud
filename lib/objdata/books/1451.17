Applys

Applys are abilities or affects that accrue to whomever is using the item.
Applys only accrue if the item is worn or held.  Inventory doesn't count.

You should adjust the item cost depending on the applys it has.

LIGHT: don't set this, make it (glow) and things will be set correctly.
	The only time you should set this is if you are making a lamppost, etc
AC:   puts AC on the item
HIT:  adds hit points to the wearer
MANA: adds mana to the wearer (If you apply this, you need to set lower
	structure than you otherwise might)
SKILLS AND SPELLS: affects the wearer/use the skill or spell number
	(see help <skill/spell> files)
IMMUNITIES: these are already set by material type but you can add some
	immunity affects if they make sense.
VISION: adds to the vision bonus of the wearer
CAN BE SEEN: adds to the can be seen of the wearer (how much light is needed
	for them to be seen)
TOHIT: alters characters ability to hit others in combat  (restrictions apply)
TODAM: alters amount of damage done in combat.  (restrictions apply)
