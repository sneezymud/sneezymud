Building: Laying out the Rooms

Before you start laying out the rooms you should set up a few things.

Create some aliases:
	alias mexitn edit exit 0 0 0 -1 -1 -1
	alias mexite edit exit 1 0 0 -1 -1 -1
	alias mexits edit exit 2 0 0 -1 -1 -1
	alias mexitw edit exit 3 0 0 -1 -1 -1
	alias mexitu edit exit 4 0 0 -1 -1 -1
	alias mexitd edit exit 5 0 0 -1 -1 -1
	alias mexitne edit exit 6 0 0 -1 -1 -1
	alias mexitnw edit exit 7 0 0 -1 -1 -1
	alias mexitse edit exit 8 0 0 -1 -1 -1
	alias mexitsw edit exit 9 0 0 -1 -1 -1

Now, goto one of your rooms and use REDIT to modify the sector type,
room flags and height. You probably want to check out the redit book,
it tells you how to use the REDIT editor, even though it's pretty
intuitive. Just type REDIT while standing in the room and you'll be
taken into the editor. Sneezy has a nice feature that if you set the
sector, height and room flags on a room, then create exits to new rooms,
it copies that information.

Now you can start laying out the rooms. Type <alias> <room number> to
create an exit in the direction specified to the room number specified.
ie: mexitn 1 - creates an exit from the room you're in north to room 1.

Move on to your next room and repeat the process until all your exits
have been made. Once you're finished, RSAVE your work. Just type RSAVE
to save your progress.
