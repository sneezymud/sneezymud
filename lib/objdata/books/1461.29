Advanced Action: checktoggle
---------------------

ex:
<trigger> { "<arguments>";
       <other actions>;
       checktoggle <number>;
       <other actions>;
     }

Checktoggle is used to check for the presence of a given quest-toggle before
performing additional actions.  Actions after the checktoggle are only
performed if the performer has the given toggle bit set.  Otherwise, the
subsequent actions are ignored.  If the bit is not set, the other responses the
mob has will be compared to allow 1 trigger to have separate actions based
on presence of quest bits (you would need multiple response blocks set up
though).
