        <d>The Duties of A Deacon
      In the Knighthood of Aaron <1>



The duties of a Deacon lay the foundation for the
<d>Holy Order <1>.
The primary concern of a deacon is to <d>fellowship new
members <1> of the <d>Holy Order <1>.
This involves striving to welcome the new brethren
through the kindness of a friend and patience of a
brother.  Though yet new in the Order this calling
provides an opportunity to strengthen fellow deacons,
as well as forge bonds that will last throughout your
life.

Deacons are also to <d>participate in ordinances <1> of
the Knighthood.  This entails being present for the
ceremonial <d>knighting of new members <1>, as well as the
<d>ordination of current members <1> to offices within the
Order.

Deacons also have the special task of <d>collecting fast
offerings for the needy once a month <1>.
This entails a fast by the members that is used on
behalf of those in our community who may be struggling
financially.  Often what may be but a simple days meal
to us may provide much for those in need.  The members
will contribute the money they would have spent on their
days sustenance while fasting to the Knighthood.
This fast offering is a chance to be unselfish and
sacrifice something we need very much for the welfare of
another.

This preparatory Knighthood while not possessing all the
responsibilities of an Elder is a time to learn service
and the responsibilities associated with the Title you
bear.  Strive to be clean in thought, speech and deed.
Let virtue garnish thy every adventure.  Lead by example
and you will find treasures richer then those of the
mightiest dragons.

Welcome to the Knighthood <d>Brother <n> <1> ,
may you magnify your calling and learn the gift of Love.
