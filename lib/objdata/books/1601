General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE AGE OF FAERIES:

At the beginning of time there was The World, and it was rich in magik.  Great
currents of pure and raw power coursed through the air, the land, and the sea.
And the Faeriefolk who populated The World turned this power to their own uses
in ways inconceivable to even today's greatest wizards.  The Faeries were at
peace, seeking only to explore the limits of their magikal abilities.

Ultimately, the Faeriefolk had pushed back all frontiers and learned all there
was to know about magik.  It had become such a natural part of them that it
was impossible to distinguish what was natural and what was magikal.  And in
fact, the distinction had lost all meaning for the Faeries.  Thought was
reality, and reality was whatever imagination could devise.

But there arose a counter-culture.  A small band of Faeries began to shun
their magikal heritage and explore their natural environment without the use
of their powers.  To The Elders, this was unnatural and obscene.  As the
dissidents grew in number, the outrage The Elders felt became more intense.

-*-* "How can they let themselves be harmed when a mere thought could remove
      the hazard?"
*&*& "They say they wish not to interfere with the natural world; thinking
      the hazard away would violate their goals."
-*-* "Fine then, let them shift themselves out of harm's way."
*&*& "I too do not understand."
