Building: Response Files

Response files are what cause a mobile to respond and interact with
players. It is how you set up a quest for your zone.

They are created offline and then attached to a mobile. It's really
just a text file with directives.

Use the RESPONSE BOOK to help you in creating your file. It can be
found in the bookshelf at the Builder's Lounge in room 2.
