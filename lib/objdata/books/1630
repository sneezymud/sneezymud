General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
RESULTS OF THE THIRD ELF-DWARF WAR

A handful of achievements were realized during this war though.  The art of
warfare of course advanced immensely.  Dwarven metal lore and eleven magics
were pushed to their limits and many useful developments in these areas were
realized.  Hobbits profited greatly during this period, selling their foods to
regions laid waste by war.

At the same time, gnomes found themselves in a difficult position.  They felt
morally bound to end the bloodshed, but to do so they needed to achieve the
respect of both sides.  Using typically convoluted gnomish logic, they set
about to stop the war by creating better weapons.  The weapons would be given
to one side or the other to earn the gratitude of that group, and it was
hoped that they could parley this gratitude into influence and the influence
into a means to end the war.  Strangely enough, it worked, but much blood was
shed by these fantastic weapons and the existence of these items remains a blot
on the collective minds of every gnome.

A handful of these items survive today, being much treasured for their
destructive capabilities.  But for every true device, a dozen cheap imitations
are sold by fake peddlers in antiquities.  And of course many of these weapons
were destroyed during the war or obliterated by the gnomes as a step of
penance later on.
