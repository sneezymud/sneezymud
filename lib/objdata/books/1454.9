The 'M' command
load a mob in a room

The 'M' command loads a mob in a room.

M <if_flag> <mob vnum> <max_exist> <room vnum>

<if_flag> is typically 0 (proper loads are controlled by use of max_exists)
<mob vnum> is vnum mob is saved as
<max_exist> loads a mob if there are fewer than this number IN THE ROOM.
             see note on end for tips on setting
<room vnum> is the room to put the mob in

Simple load of a single mob:

M 0 100 4 102        orc

loads an orc (vnum 100) into room 102 provided there are 3 or less orcs
(vnum 100) in room 102.


NOTES:
  Total max_exist of a mob in The World is controlled by the Max_Exist
number set on the mob itself.  Because your loads of mobs will effect
max_exist numbers of mobs throughout The World, you should not load any
mobs from any other zones without the express approval of the LOW.
