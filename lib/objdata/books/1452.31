There is no way to create a mob out of the ether, so you have to load an
exisiting monster and modify it to suit your needs. There are test mobs
available from levels 1 to 50, warrior class. Use SHOW MOB TEST for a list.

You can also load and modify a mob that exists in the world. When doing so,
check throughly each option of the medit menu so you don't have any left
overs.
