           <d>The First Book of Vangard <1>

<y>Chapter 1 <1>

<y>1. <1>I Vangard having been born of goodly parents,
and taught in the language of my father,
do herein make a record of my days.
<y>2. <1>I was born in the year of the Prophets 620 in the lands known as the
Frontier.  My Father was a just and true teacher who taught me much
in the way of the Knighthood and in my ancestry.
<y>3. <1>Jedin my older brother used to tell me of his adventures
in the Knighthood while we played amidst the forests of Mount Kolvir,
and hunted beasts for food.
<y>4. <1>I had never ventured to the pinnacle of the mountain, nor had Jedin,
yet in the year 635 when I was just old enough to hold my Fathers
Holy Defender, I embarked upon the journey that would change my life.
<y>5. <1>Jedin had been called off on a crusade against ice trolls
to the north, and having been left behind I went to the mountain
to pray for his safety.

<y>Chapter 2 <1>

<y>1. <1>As I knelt I felt compelled upward. Without further thought I obeyed.
I climbed until the air began to thin and yet I was lifted yet again
to my feet and carried heavenward towards the mountain peak.
<y>2. <1>The way was rugged and steep, without path or foothold.
I looked about myself and grew scared as a mist of darkness
descended down upon me.  A cloud I thought.
<y>3. <1>The penetrating wetness made movement even more deadly,
yet I was determined now to reach the highest point of Mount Kolvir.
<y>4. <1>Just as I saw light upon the icy peak shattering the mist around me,
I was overcome with an exhaustion that did cause me to quake
and tremble exceedingly for fear I should fall from my ledge.
<y>5. <1>I felt as though my short life had come to a close
when upon my shoulder I felt a hand pulling me upward
which set me safely upon the Mountain preface.
<y>6. <1>Before me shown a Man whose brightness exceeded
that of the sunlight reflecting upon the ice before me.

<y>7. <1><c>"Vangard son of Lancen, <1>
<c>I am Elyon Creator and most High Deity, <1>
<c>behold Jevon, listen, <1>
<c>for he hath a purpose for you." <1>

<y>8. <1>Looking to the right, I beheld another Man
clothed as a beggar that was hereto hidden from my sight
amidst the Glory of the former.
<y>9. <1>His eyes were of kindness and mercy.
As he spoke with a softness of a breeze I felt a love for me in his voice.

<y>10.<1> <c>"Fear not brother, for you have done well before me. <1>
<y>11.<1> <c>Go ye unto the Cathedral in Brightmoon, <1>
<c>and collect the records of your fathers contained there in. <1>
<y>12.<1> <c>You are to explain that we have been with them <1>
<c>from the beginning. <1>
<y>13.<1> <c>Yea, we have watched our children give ye truth
through a chosen Prophet, our son Galek. <1>
<y>14.<1> <c>Now ye shall be called to restore thy fallen Order <1>
<c>to its true beauty and fullness of purpose. <1>
<y>15.<1> <c>Go now, and learn of thy past; <1>
<c>grow in stature and in knowledge; <1>
<c>we shall return and visit you in a time." <1>

<y>Chapter 3 <1>

<y>1. <1> I was left to myself to collapse.
I slept.
<y>3. <1>However, what I had seen was as clear and as poignant
to my mind as the moment it occurred.
<y>4. <1>As I stood, I heard the huffing of a winged horse
whose snorting blew mist into the cold mountain air.
<y>5. <1>I approached it instinctively.
Sliding my hand along the main of the mythical beast,
<y>6. <1>I gently mounted his unsaddled back.
He stood firm.
<y>7. <1>Then soaring into the sky I was returned to my home.

<y>Chapter 4 <1>

<y>1. <1>As soon as I packed my belongings, my brother and I departed for
Grimhaven.
<y>2. <1>There I met my best friend Azor.
We took employment as street cleaners,
ridding the town of rats and the like.
<y>3. <1>I knew I had a purpose elsewhere,
and before long I departed alone to traverse the treacherous
Parnitian Mountain range filled with terrific Tytans in hopes of reaching the
fabled Brightmoon home of Galek the Wise.
<y>4. <1>After much tribulation, I arrived at the gates of the city
only to be told by the Bishops' priests I would not be able
to gain an audience with the Bishop until
I had first proven myself worthy of the Knighthood.
<y>5. <1>They sent me to quell the wicked Drow uprisings
in an effort to strength relations with the Druids in that Area.

<y>Chapter 5 <1>

<y>1. <1>I did as I was instructed spending several years
vanquishing Dark Elves from the land.
<y>2. <1>I returned 3 years later to be dubbed a Crusader by the hand of Dra
into the Knighthood of Aaron.
<y>3. <1>Finally, I was permitted to study the ancient texts of the Prophets.
<y>4. <1>The vision of Elyon and Jevon never faded from my mind....
I saw their hand in all our successes and wisdom within their Prophet,
Galek the Wise.
<y>5. <1>The breadth of my mission did not occur to me until much later.

<y>Chapter 6 <1>

<y>1. <1>In time the growth of the Cult was manifested by the emergence
of the Templars. Anxieties in the land grew numerous.
<y>2. <1>Crusaders were sent to Grimhaven to stand against Drow and Kobold
invasions.
<y>3. <1>There the merchants had grown strong and assembled themselves in one body
representative of their goals and desires.
<y>4. <1>The Arena was erected to settle the many quarrels that emerged
within the teeming society, helping to calm the populous.
<y>5. <1>Nevertheless, there were many among them who began to be proud,
contending warmly with their adversaries, even unto blows;
yea, they would smite one another with their fists.
<y>6. <1>The distinctions between factions soon grew into contentions,
false doctrines were taught as truth.
Yea, and they did persecute one another and afflict each other with words.
<y>7. <1>Hearts were hardened,
and many names were blotted out from amongst even the Knighthood.
Now this was a great trial to those that did stand fast in the faith;
nevertheless, they were steadfast and immovable
in keeping the commandments of Elyon delivered by the hand of Galek himself,
and they bore with patience the persecutions which were heaped upon them.
<y>8. <1>And they did impart of their substance,
every Knight according to that which he had, to the poor,
and the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted
for there were indeed many caused by the greed of the Snake Merchants.
<y>9. <1>Yea, and they did not wear costly apparel,
yet they were neat and comely.
And thus, in their prosperous circumstances,
they did not send away any who were naked,
or that were hungry, or that were athirst.
<y>10.<1> Their hearts were not set upon riches,
therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young,
both bond and free, both male and female,
whether without the Knighthood or within,
having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.

<y>Chapter 7 <1>

<y>1. <1>In the commencement of the 674th year of the Prophets
there began to be a contention among the people;
for a certain man being called Bertrand Farreach of Amber,
he being a very cunning man, yea, and a wise man
as to the wisdom of the World, he being after the Order of the Red.
<y>2. <1>Now this Bertrand had drawn away much of the People after him;
even so much that they began to be very powerful;
and began to endeavor to establish Bertrand as king over the people.
<y>3. <1>Now this was alarming to the people of the land for they knew
that according to their law such things were to be established
by their voices alone.
<y>4. <1>Therefore, if it were possible that Bertrand should
gain the voice of the people and possession of the throne,
he being a man of the World,
would deprive them of their rights and privileges of worship;
for it was his intent to destroy the Knighthood.
<y>5. <1>And thus did the people assemble themselves together,
every man according to his mind, whether it be for or against Bertrand.
<y>6. <1>And it came to pass that the voice of the people came against Bertrand,
that he was not made king over the people.
<y>7. <1>Now this did cause much joy amongst the brethren of the Knighthood,
yet Bertrand did stir up anger against those who were not in his favor.
<y>8. <1>And it came to pass that his followers did assemble themselves together
and did consecrate Bertrand to be their King.
<y>9. <1>And he did command them to take up arms against their brethren;
and this he did that he might subject them to him.
<y>10.<1> Now never before had the people of Grimhaven seen so much carnage.
<y>11.<1> Nevertheless, Elyon did strengthen the hands of the freemen of Grimhaven
that they slew those of Order of Bertrand with great slaughter,
that they began to flee before them.
<y>12.<1> And it came to pass that those Freemen
did pursue the Red Order all that day,
and did slay them with much slaughter,
insomuch that there were slain of the Order of Bertrand
twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls;
and there were slain of the Freemen six thousand five hundred and two souls.
<y>13.<1> And when the King of Grimhaven could pursue Bertrand no longer the Proctor
of Brightmoon Augustine the Great sent forth spies to follow
the remnant of the Red Order Elite forces,
that he might know of their plans and their plots,
whereby he might assist the King of Grimhaven in guarding against them,
that he might preserve the people from being destroyed.

<y>Chapter 8 <1>

<y>1. <1>Yea, and those spies struck with great fear did return with haste saying,

<c>"Behold, we followed the camp of the Red Order, <1>
<c>and to our great astonishment, <1>
<c>in the land of the Great Waste above the land of the Dark elves <1>
<c>we saw a numerous host of Logrites; <1>
<c>and behold Bertrand and the Red Order have joined them! <1>
<c>And they are upon our brethren in that Land even those Druids, <1>
<c>and they are fleeing from before them with their flocks, <1>
<c>and their wives, and their children towards our city; <1>
<c>and except we make haste they will attain possession of our city <1>
<c>and also of our families!" <1>

<y>2. <1>Further reports by our spies indicated that The Templars,
lead by Deus and Ebon, had declared war against Brightmoon.
<y>3. <1>I was called to strike back at the heart of Logrus,
The Grandmaster himself, while the primary front led by the Guardian
would make their stand the flats on the banks of the river Kranor.
