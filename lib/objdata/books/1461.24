SUBSTRING: OBJCOST
---------------------

ex:
give { "-#OBJCOST( 300, 10)#";
       <action>;
	say "I received #OBJCOST( 300, 10)# talens!";
       <action>;
     }

The OBJCOST substring was developed in response to the large number of
response mobs that were acting as traders.  In essence, it allows you
to embed the price of an object into a script.  Obviously, item prices
tend to fluxuate over the long haul, so this is a good way to let the
scripts adjust for this possible change.

The string MUST follow a certain syntax.  That syntax is:
#OBJCOST( obj_vnum, markup_percent)#

obj_vnum is the virtual number of the item in question.  In this example,
item #300 is a long sword.

Markup is an int allowing for the cost to be incremented slightly over its
true cost.  In this example, we are indicating we want the price to be 10%
more than its true cost.

When this mob is loaded, it will determine what the current market value
of a sword is (plus 10%), and derive the proper response.  For instance, if
a long sword's price (in the tinyfile) was 1000 talens, the following
response would be created:

give { "-1100";
	say I have been given 1100 talens;
	}

Thus, the substring has been replaced by the derived pricing.  And if a
subsequent change is made to the item that affects its price, your script
will not need to be updated.
