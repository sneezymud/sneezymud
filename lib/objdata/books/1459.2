GENERAL OVERVIEW AND GOALS

In general <h> 5.0 will differ from <h> 4.1 in that there will
be an increase reliance on both race and skill learning in deciding what
you can do and skill learning will be not just dependent on intelligence
and level but how long or often you have used a skill. Stats are important
but they are not an independent category.  They are majorly influenced by
your choice of race.  There are planned racial skills and attributes that
will further affect your character and which will help us to adjust
balances if needed.
