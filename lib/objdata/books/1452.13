Damage Level

This is the amount of damage the mob does when hitting barehand.  It is
entered in the form X+Y, where X is the damage level and Y is the randomizer,
meaning Y will make the mob hit + or - Y% the damage of that level.  


NOTES:

RELATION TO LEVEL:  The barehand damage and number of attacks is the
primary determinant of a mobs level although the level is affected by a
few other stat choices.
