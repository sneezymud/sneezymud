<h> Official Policy: Multiplay
---------------------------------------

SneezyMUD allows you to make and play as many characters and classes as you
like.  There is one main rule concerning the use of multiple characters.

You are only allowed to have ONE character connected to the mud at any
given time.  There are NO exceptions.  This one PC rule applies to
characters in the inn and link dead characters.  You are not allowed
to switch characters by dropping the link of one of them.  You must
find an inn and rent your character before logging another on line.
Having multiple accounts, to facilitate multiplaying or otherwise, is
prohibited.

If you have forgotten your account password you may mail
mudadmin@sneezymud.com for assistance.  DO NOT create multiple
accounts if you have forgotten your password.
