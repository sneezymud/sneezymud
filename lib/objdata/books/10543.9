Section 9

Work Begins on New Monk Temple

  After many years of amassing money donations from loyal monks, the High
Tabuda is ready to begin construction on a monk temple that will serve as
the focal point for all monks.  Though the whereabouts of the unfinished
temple is being kept secret, there is no doubt that a lot more funds will
be needed in order to complete it.  Monk leaders from all across the realm
urge aspiring monks to give generously to the Order.  To help encourage
unity among monks everywhere, the High Tabuda has announced the
introduction of a martial arts belt system.  He was interviewed about this
new system and happily explained, "Several monk trainers and spiritual
leaders will help with this system by offering quests to achieve a belt.
Though each monk has a different style of teaching, it is hoped that this
universal belt system will build a feeling of closeness among all monks
across The World."  With the building of a new monk temple and a universal
belt system, it is quite possible that the ranks of monks everywhere will
be swelling.
