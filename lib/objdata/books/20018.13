GRIMHAVEN HIDE AND SEEK (HIDING):  All contestants will meet in the
Mud-Wide Contestant's Lounge in the area above Grimhaven Center Square.
At the appointed time contestants will be divided into one of 4 groups of
at least 4 or more contestants.  Each contestant within a group will take
turns hiding in Grimhaven and being sought by the others in his or her
group.  The hider will be given a decent head start to hide somewhere in
Grimhaven.  Once hidden, the hider must tell the Tournament Organizer his
location.  He can not move from that location once hidden.  The other
contestants will form a group and try to find the hider.  Once a hider is
found, the group will meet in Center Square and a different contestant
will hide.  The contestant that stays hidden within a group the longest
shall be declared a winner.  There is a 1/2 hour limit on a given heat.
If more than one hider in a group lasts the full time limit (doubtful),
there will be run off heats with more players helping to seek :).  After a
winner has been found from each group, there will be a final heat between
all the winners of the lesser heats.  NOTE: The sewers will not be
included, however the theater, church, palace, mage academy, thief hideout
etc. are valid areas.  Further, no rangers should participate in this
event.  If your primary pc is a ranger, make a newbie or play one of your
other characters.  Mages and winners will be tested for the presence of
track spell.
