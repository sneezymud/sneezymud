The forums and NEWS.
--------------------------

The administrators have set up a forum for the players of
SneezyMUD to chat, ask one another for advice and help, schedule
groups, buy and sell equipment, pitch ideas and report minor
bugs.  You can find this forum at http://forums.sneezymud.com

Please familiarize yourself with the forum policies, posted in
the General Discussion board.  The SneezyMUD forums are for the
most part unmoderated, but rare exceptions are made for specific
purposes or for extreme situations.  As such, the administrators
rarely keep up to date with the general discussion boards, but
do make a point to keep up on the bugs and ideas boards.  You
can still use the BUG, IDEA and TYPO commands to report non-
critical issues.

Urgent issues should always be brought to the attention of a
god personally.  If one is not immediately available on the MUD
or the MUD is not available, use the Contact Us link to leave
us a message: http://www.sneezymud.com/Contact_Us.html .  We
will see your message as soon as we check back in and get back
to you via your preferred contact method ASAP.

News updates are posted both to the forums and the in-game
"news" command.

As <h> is quite often updated with new codes and rules, it
is important that you be aware of these changes. Ignorance of
new rules is not an excuse on <h>. Players are expected to
keep themselves updated on all the new information the immortals
take the time to write.

The news command is among the most important informative in-game
commands on <h>.  Important code updates and helpfile changes
will be put in the <h> news.  Be sure to check it regularly for
new information. After reboots is a particularly good time to check
the news as code update is always preceded by a reboot.

<h> Newsletter and the Website
-----------------------------------
<h> issues a periodic newsletter with information about the
game, including new features and zones, upcoming quests or
contests and other updates.  You can subscribe by visiting
the website at: http://www.sneezymud.com

The <h> web page offers various information about our players
and volunteers, as well as a help page and links to other
services such as the SneezyMUD calendar of events, the news-
letter, the wiki, the forums and more.
