What is a Response Quest?
------------------------

Response quests are special standing quests that represent challenges for
the players to overcome.  They typically involve providing a series of
clues each of which leads the player along some set path until the quest
is completed.  The clues take the form of having the mob make a statement
or perform some action based on the actions of the player.

Response quests are generated from text files generated offline.  There is
presently no online support for the response files.
