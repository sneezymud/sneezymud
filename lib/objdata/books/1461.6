Trigger: roomenter
---------------------

ex:
roomenter { "";
       <action>;
       <action>;
     }

roomenter { "100";
       <action>;
       <action>;
     }

Roomenter will be triggered anytime a PC enters the room with the response
mob.  It does not trigger for NPCs.

Roomenter with an argument of "" will trigger all the time.  With a numeric
argument, the roomenter trigger will only fire if the number indicated is
the room the PC entered FROM.  In the above example, it will fire if they
came from room 100.  The intention of this latter trigger is to allow you
to write different responses based on direction of travel; obviously, your
trigger mob should be set sentinel for this to work though.

One caveat with this trigger, PCs often move in groups.  A tremendous amount
of spam can be generated by this trigger unless the actions are set up
carefully.  In general, do not have the action do anything that is seen
by everyone.  ie, limit yourself to tells or tovict actions.

The main purpose of this trigger is to indicate the mob as a response mob
and to provide clues as to what PCs may want to ask about for other responses.
eg, if a separate response has PCs asking about a small key the mob has, then
a good roomenter trigger might be to have the mob fiddling with the small
key when they come in.
