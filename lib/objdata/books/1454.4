The actual commands in the zone file have to follow a strict format as
the mud reads them in and a badly formatted command may cause strange results.

Each command must be on its own line.   Each command will instruct the
mud to 1) reset an exit, 2) load and instruct a mob, or load and place an
object.

Also, you will explain the intended purpose of each of your commands in a
comment following your command (but on the same line) so that if changes
are required later your zonefile can be read easier.  Otherwise it is just
a list of numbers.

The last thing you zone file can contain are non executable comment lines.
These can be instructions for the LOW, comments about the zone, or a
command you would like put in later.  To have a non-executed line you need
to start the line with a *, that line will be then be skipped by the code.

General format of a <command> is:
<command_type> <if_flag> <arg> <arg> <arg> ...[explanation of command]

COMMAND_TYPE:  Command_type is a single capital letter.  Each will be
dealt with in depth in later chapters.  In general, it tells the processor
what it will be doing eg. an M command loads a mob, a D command handles a
door, an E command equips somebody with something, etc.

IF_FLAG:  The if_flag is somewhat confusing, so pay attention.  The
if_flag determines the condition when the command will be operated.

	An if_flag of 0 means operate this command regardless of
                   circumstances each time the mud resets the zone.
	An if_flag of 1 means operate this command ONLY IF the
                   previous command was executed.

Why is this important?  For commands like adding mobs to the room you will
probably always want to execute the command (if_flag 0).  But for commands
like adding equipment, where you don't want execution to occur if the mob
the equipment is on didn't load, use if_flag 1. Screwing up the if_flag
may cause your equipment to load itself in strange places or crash the
game.

ARGS:  The <args> depend on what command is being used. (See later chapters)
