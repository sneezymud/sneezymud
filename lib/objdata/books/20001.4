Description and Rules: This event is designed to test your head hunting
skills.  You will be assigned a color coded contestant character to
participate in this event.  At the appointed event time, you will meet
with a tournament organizer who will go over last minute details and
assign you this color and this contestant character.

Upon logging your color-coded character in, the tournament organizer will
give you a special tournament weapon.  This weapon has been specially
designed to kill special "prey" characters in one hit.  Gods or other
contestants will log in "prey" characters who have been set so that one
hit from your tournament weapon will kill them.  Your mission if you
choose to accept it will be to kill three of these "prey" characters and
bring their heads to the tournament organizer.

The event will take place in color-coded square tournament pits.  They are
well lit and contain no surprises.  These pits range in size from 25 rooms
to 100 rooms.  Each pit has an exit back to the tournament organizer.
Only one wall will have this exit, but it will be clearly marked in every
room description.

The prey characters will enter the pit before you and from a different
directions.  They may be gods they may be other contestants.  In either
case, they will try to avoid you and your weapon.  They shall flee your
wrath and skill often and fast.  You shall show them no mercy.

The prey will die in one hit from your weapon.  In the corpse
you will find a head.  When you have collected a specified number of heads
run for the exit and give the head(s) to the judge who will have timed
you.  The winner of a heat will be the contestant with the fastest time.
The event will also have a time limit of 15 minutes in which case the
winner will be the contestant with the most heads.  Ties will be resolved
in a run off heat.

This event will be run in heats.  You will be grouped randomly in groups
of four (4).  The winners of these groups will then compete against each
other to determine the event winner and runner-up.  May the best head
hunter win.
