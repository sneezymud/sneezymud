Welcome to immortality! :)

You are probably a level 51 builder, which means you can't do much
besides build. The building learning process requires some patience
and a lot of reading. Here you'll find the basic stuff to get started.

Use command: READ CHAPTER (#) OF BUILDER where (#) is one of:

1. Getting started
2. Planning: Theme and Contents
3. Planning: Mapping
4. Building: Laying out the Rooms
5. Building: Room Name
6. Building: Room Description
7. Building: Checking your Work with Rooms
8. Building: Objects
9. Building: Mobiles
10. Building: Response Files
11. Wrapping up: Zonefile
