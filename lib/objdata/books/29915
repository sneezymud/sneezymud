          <d>The Duties of A Teacher
         In the Knighthood of Aaron <1>


Teachers lay the chief cornerstone of our brotherhood.
The Teacher primary role is to watch over the Order
strengthening them.  Using the <d>Edicts of Faith, <1>
<d>Tenets of Membership and Eyes of Elyon <1> a Teacher
has the tools needed to help foster peace and love
within the <d>Holy Order <1> , and insure harmony between
the members.

A Teachers goal should be to <d> assure that there is <1>
<d>no iniquity, neither lying, nor backbiting, <1>
<d>nor evil speaking within the ranks of the <1>
<d>Knighthood. <1>
This can be done through example, as well was
<d>Home Teaching assignments <1> .  <d>Encourage <1> others
to <d>live the Edicts of Faith <1>
<d>and Tenets of Membership <1> to which each of them have
committed.  Encourage the members to pay a
<d>full tithe <1> and remind them of the blessings that
may come from doing so.
Always <d>support your leaders <1> even though at times
you may not agree with the policies decided upon.  This
will serve to unite us and forge a mighty nation built
upon peace.

In the absence of a Knight of Melchizedek or a Crusader
the Teacher is to conduct and preside over all
<d>Holy Order <1> meetings.  Although a Teacher
<d>may not Knight others <1> this preparatory time
provides many opportunities to fellowship with other
members as well as participate in the various ordinances
of the Knighthood.  Through such affiliation the
procedures and responsibilities akin to such events will
become ingrained within our hearts.

      Once again the Brotherhood thanks you all for the
great acts of service which you perform on our behalf.
Correlate often and learn of thy duties.  May thy hard
work and diligence bring forth much fruit not only
within the Brotherhood, but also without.

      All my love to you <d>Brother <n> <1>,

Vangard Prophet of the Holy Order
