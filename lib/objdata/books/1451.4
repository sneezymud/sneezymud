Long Description

The items long description is what is shown when the item is lying on
the ground.

It needs to be a complete sentence, starting with a capital letter and ending
with a period.  The standard is to have it fit on one line, although you
can certainly go over if need be, just make sure you allow for 80 character
screenwidths.

eg.
A large sword lies here.
Someone has left behind a perfectly good blackscale helmet.
In one corner of the room sits a oaken desk.

NOTES:

CONNECTION WITH SHORT DESCRIPTION AND NAME:  It should not be identical
but give some clue how to manipulate the item meaning the long should
contain all the elements of the short and the item name.
