Chapter 2:  Types of Events.

There are three basic types of events planned and a bunch of extras such
as Trivia and Sleeptag.

A.  MUD WIDE EVENTS:  These events will take place throughout The World
that you know.  Most will center in Grimhaven although some will take
place outside of the city.  Among the events planned are:

	Experience Challenges:  Most experience gained in an hour solo
				and in a group (level based)

	Alignment Challenges:   Like the above but for alignment gains.

	Level Challenges:	Fastest competitor to level a newbie
				created by them.

	Hide and Seek:          One competitor hides.  The rest try to find.

	Races:			Races throughout the mud.  Don't set client
				macros ...exits will be changed leading to
				mega deathtraps :).

	Scavenger Hunts:	Mini Quests run by the Tournament Organizer.
