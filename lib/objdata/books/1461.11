Action: load
---------------------

ex:
<trigger> { "<arguments>";
       <other actions>;
       load <number>;
       <other actions>;
     }

Load will allow the trigger-mob to create items.  <number> must be positive
and represents the vnum of the object that should be created.  The loaded
item will end up in the trigger mobs inventory (for subsequent giving, etc).

Use good judgment about what is loaded.  Limited items, items from other
people's zone used without permission, etc will all cause problems.

To prevent load piling up objects, if the mob already has the item indicated
in inventory, load will do nothing.  If you really want to load 2 (or more)
items, load one, drop it, load the next, then get the item.  This trick is not
recommended since volume/weight may still cause problems.

A negative number is interpreted as a positive number of talens to load.

At this time, it is not possible to create other creatures.
