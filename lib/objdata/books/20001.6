Description and Rules: This event is designed to test your archery hunting
skills.  You will be assigned a color coded contestant character to
participate in this event.  At the appointed event time, you will meet
with a tournament organizer who will go over last minute details and
assign you this color and this contestant character.

Upon logging your color-coded character in, the tournament organizer will
give you a special tournament bow and arrow set.  This bow has been
specially designed to kill special "prey" characters in one hit.  These
"prey" characters will be mixed in with various "innocents".  Both will be
stationary and not flee your wrath.  Your mission if you choose to accept
it will be to spare the innocent and kill a designate number of these
"prey" characters and bring their heads to the tournament organizer.

The event will take place in color-coded square tournament pits.  They are
well lit and contain no surprises.  These pits range in size from 25 rooms
to 100 rooms.  Each pit has an exit back to the tournament organizer.
Only one wall will have this exit, but it will be clearly marked in every
room description.

The prey and innocent characters will have already entered the pit before
you and from a different directions.  The prey will die in one hit from
your weapon.  In the corpse you will find a head.  When you have killed
all of the prey and collected their heads run for the exit and give the
head(s) to the judge who will have timed you.  The judge will then check
on how many innocents you have killed.  The judge will then divide your
time by the number of prey minus the number of innocents that you killed.
Formula is Time/(Prey minus Innocents).  The winner of a heat will be the
contestant with the fastest time after this adjustment.  The event will
also have a time limit of 15 minutes in which case the winner will be the
contestant with the most "prey" heads adjusted for the number of innocents
killed.  Ties will be resolved in a run off heat.

May the best archer win.
