Chapter 4:

C.  SKILL TESTING:  These events will take place in a special Tournament
zone created for the tournament and will involve the use of special PC's
created by the gods to test your mudding skills.  You will not use your
own PC's but will use PC's created to have certain characteristics.
These events will mostly involve avoidance and hunting games which will
test your ability to find and kill or avoid other PC's played by various
gods and other competitors.  Among the events planned for this site are:

	Archery:  		Find and shoot a variety of targets with
			      	special bows and arrows.

	Spell Casting:		Find and cast on various PC's seeking to
				avoid you.  Some of them may have certain
				immunities to various spells.

	Hunter/Prey:		Similar to Sleeptag.  Find and kill various
				PC's trying to avoid you.  One hit will
				kill them.

	Prey/Hunter		Similar to the above except you are the prey.

	Races 			Sprint races designed to find the fastest
				mudder.
