END TO END RACE:  These races will involve and test your skill and speed
at navigating the virtual world of <h>.  The races are not timed,
whoever finishes first is the victor.  There will be second and third
place prizes awarded.  NOTE:  Many exits will be changed to avoid cheating
by using macros.  Those using macros will probably end up finishing last.

frontier. Contestants are to meet at the Mud-Wide Contestant's Lounge in
the area above Grimhaven Center Square at the appointed time unless
otherwise posted on the Tournament/quest board.  Transportation will be
