The 'B' command
Load Booty

This command is identical in all respects to the 'O' command.  The only
difference is that B commands will be executed at zone reset time.  Use
this command EXTREMELY sparingly.  Loading an item in this manner is
equivalent to giving it away as it just lies on the ground free for the
taking.

B <if_flag> <obj vnum> <max_exist> <room vnum>

See notes on 'O' command for more details on what the fields are.

The max_exist number specifies the number of objects to load in the room,
up to and including that number, but not more or less.

NOTES:

LOW APPROVAL:  You should seek approval for the use of any B commands on
any items other than food stuffs or other perishables.
