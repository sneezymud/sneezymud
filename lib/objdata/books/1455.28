How come my stats aren't what I chose initially?
------------------------------------------------
(stat flux)

This question is commonly asked by players after they view their stats with the
ATTRIBUTE command.  The short answer to this question is that they are.  The
real answer is that the stats you set initially are used as a baseline.
However, a slight variation from this baseline is implemented based on the
player's age.  For instance, a younger PC will have increased strength and
karma, but lower intelligence and wisdom, while more elderly PC's essentially
have the reverse of this.
