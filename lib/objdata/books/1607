General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE FIRST ELF-DWARF WAR:

When news of the massacre at Turing Heights reached the Faeries, their
confusion was pronounced.  "What have we done?" they asked The Elders.  But The
Elders had no answer to give and so the Faeries wept.  Their Tears fell toward
The World, and where the Tears struck the earth, lesser faeries - dryads,
naiads, satyrs, pixies and nymphs sprang forth.  Because the Tears were of
sorrow, what sprang from the Tears would be eternally optimistic and happy.
Because the Tears were shed by Faeries who would never forget their folly,
their faerie offspring would be unable to remember a thing.

It is also said that when the Dwarves saw their Faerie masters crying, they
became enraged.  "Is this not what we were supposed to do?" asked the Dwarves.
"Why do they weep for these Elves and cast us down?" they wondered.  The Dwarf
leaders came to realize how little their Faerie creators respected them, and
vowed never to follow their lead again.  They cast off their name and became
known as dwarves.  At the same time, their original purpose of harassing the
Elves changed into a general hatred for all things of the Faeries.  The dwarves
caught some of the Faerie Tears as they fell and planted them deep within their
tunnels, where the magik of The World metamorphosed the Tears into brilliant
diamonds and other precious minerals.  Because these substances reminded them
of their betrayal and embarrassment, the dwarves sought these minerals out.
