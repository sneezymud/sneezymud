The <h> system of lighting and vision
-------------------------------------------

The system of lighting on <h> is most probably different from any
other MUD lighting system you have experienced.

All objects, characters and mobs are rated for how much light
is required to notice them.  Light is produced by the sun
(various amounts depending on time of day and only outside),
lanterns, light posts, torches, glowing objects, etc.  The
actual amount varies from light-source to light-source.  If
the amount of total light in a room exceeds something's "can-be-
seen" factor, then you will be able to notice it.

There are a few more quirks though.  For instance, some magic items
can cause your sight to improve, effectively giving you night vision
to one extent or another.  Also, some races have infravision which permits
HEAT sources to be seen (objects have no intrinsic heat though).

Realize that just because you can see SOME things in a room, does NOT mean
that everything is visible.  It's fairly easy to lose track of something in
dim lighting so you may actually want to bring multiple lanterns while
adventuring (put a few on the ground and light them, then hold another one
in your hand.  See HELP LIGHT.)

Finally, this light system works both ways.  Some dangerous mobs can be
bypassed by going by them at night in the dark.  Don't rely too much on this
as a lot of creatures can see in the dark.
