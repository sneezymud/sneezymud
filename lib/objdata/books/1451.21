Max Exist:

This controls how many of an item will be in world before an item will
stop loading and before hunting code will be activated (if relevant).
This as well as structure and value are the key object values that most
influence the mud economy.  Max_exist should be set according to how
powerful an item is.  Simple items and general purpose items should be
set unlimited (999).  Magic items of any power should be max_exist less
than or equal to 5.  Super items should be set Max_exist=1  Other max_exist
ranges are in the 20-30 range.

You should carefully examine The World for the max_exist of similar
items in The World and set accordingly.  Make good use of LOW command and
help files under policy.


NOTES:

RESTRICT ANY MAGIC ITEM:  You must set a limited max exist if you have
set any form of apply other than simple AC.

SERIOUSLY RESTRICT ARTIFACT QUALITY ITEMS:  You must limit artifacts to
less than 5 in world.

CONFORM YOUR MAX_EXISTS WITH ZONE FILE:  Your max exist should conform
with your max exist in zone file.

CONFORM YOUR MAX_EXISTS WITH ZONE FILE PERCENT LOADS:  Low max_exist items
should *not* have hight percentage loads or load on a large number of
mobs.  Simple math will show you if you have a max exist of 5 and you
load it 40 percent of time on 12 different mobs, you will reach your max
exist the first time some group clears a zone.  You should want your
items to load sparingly for a long time or groups will just clear the
zone the first week of production and then never come back.
