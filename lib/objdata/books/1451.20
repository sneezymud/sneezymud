Special Procedure

Special Procedures are a way of setting your mobs away from the common.
It involves coding and LOW permission to get a special procedure made for
a mob.

There are some already coded special procedures you can use. You should
get permission for anything unusual.

In addition, there are additional special procedures on mobs that you
maybe aware of in The World. If you want one of your mobs to act like a
mob in The World (like a shopkeeper or merchant) ask the LOW to put a
procedure on your mob.

Last, you can make your own special procedures by mob responses.  For
further information, read the Quest Response Book.
