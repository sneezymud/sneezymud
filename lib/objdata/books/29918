       <d>The Duties of an High Crusader <1>
      <d>In the Knighthood of Melchizedek <1>


Thy primary concern to minister to the spiritual well
being of the <d>Holy Order <1> .  There will arise many
dissensions and conflicts over time, perhaps as well
schisms in the Knighthood.  Only through the leadership
and consul of the <d>Holy Orders <1> seasoned members will
feelings be calmed and love be re-instated as paramount.
The body of <d>High Crusaders <1> are to fill the
<d>Judgment Seats <1> of Brightmoon.  They will officiate
over any claims of wrong doing, whether within of
without the Brotherhood, brought before them.  These
proceedings shall include the hearing of members
proposed for <d>excommunication <1> or to have their names
withdrawn from the records of the <d>Holy Order <1> .
These hearings must be filled with the spirit of
forgiveness and understanding for all people.  They must
be fair and just and take into consideration the
repentant heart of the individual.  Following such a
hearing the <d>High Crusaders <1> are to report their
decisions to the <d>Apostles of Administration <1> ,
as well as <d>Internal Communication <1> for the
processing of the membership records.

These same principles and proceedings will be necessary
for the <d>trial of detained Prisoners of War <1> .
Under the direction of the <d>Guardian of the Steps <1> ,
a council of <d>High Crusaders <1> are to try and penalize
captured parties.  These hearings must be performed
impartially and <d>without malice or feelings of
retribution, <1> but with the same sentiments of
<d>love and forgiveness <1> one would apply to ones own
brother.  The decision is to be delivered unto the
Guardian with the corresponding date of release and
penalty if there be any.  The Guardian will then free
the individual according to this verdict. Justice is the
foundation of the <d>Holy Order <1> doctrine and
<d>Elyon <1> will be the true Judge of iniquity.
Thy duty is simply to listen to his council and
administer the verdict.

<d>High Crusaders <1> of the <d>Holy Order <1> are to
<d>ordain <1> worthy Aaronic Knights to the
<d>Melchizedek <1> <d>Knighthood, or Elders to the office
of High Crusader only after the <1>
<d>sustaining vote <1> of the Brotherhood is attained.
If there are any opposed the matter must be discussed
and pondered till a unanimous decision can be acquired.
After extending the calling to a particular office
within the <d>Holy Order <1> , a <d>High Crusader <1> must
then insure his or her willingness to continue to serve
others both within and without the Order, as well as
sustain the Edicts of Faith and Tenets of Membership.
Once sure of the sincerity and intent of an individual,
and if ordaining to the office of an <d>High Crusader <1>
or of an <d>Elder <1> with the approval of the body of
Knights, a <d>High Crusader <1> may then ordain him or her
to an office appropriate to not only their level of
experience, but also their degree of faith.
It may be necessary for a Knight to proceed through
offices normally held by those of younger nature in
order to better prepare for the fullness of the
Knighthood.  When Knighting another a <d>High Crusader <1>
should call that person by naming asking them to kneel;
Assure that they have <d>read, understand and will <1>
<d>commit to the Edicts of Faith and Tenets of <1>
<d>Membership; <1> Laying ones hands or holy blade upon
either the Head (if by hand) or the right shoulder (if
by sword) and stating ones authority as a
<d>High Crusader <1> in the <d>Holy Order <1>
of Melchizedek, knight the individual to his or her
appropriate sphere (whether it be Melchizedek
or Aaronic ), as well as ordain them to a corresponding
office within that sphere of the Order .  Then as
directed by ones feelings pronounce words of
encouragement and upliftment welcoming them into the
Knighthood.  These ceremonies will be the source of
great excitement and rejoicing in the lives of many.
Strive to assure they are spiritually motivating and
reverent.

Finally, <d>High Crusaders <1> are to fill the Presidency
of the Melchizedek Knighthoods.  They are to serve
within the body of Elders as wizened leaders.  The
President of the Knighthood will be a <d>High Crusader <1>
set apart by the Prophet or one of his Apostles.  In
like manner shall his counselors be ordained and set
apart.  They are to officiate in the administration of
the Knighthood counseling with the
<d>Apostle of Administration <1> .  <d>The Presidency <1>
<d>of the Melchizedek Knighthood <1> is to gain direction
from the Quorum of the 12, yet are solely responsible
for the governing of the Knighthood body.  <d>High
Crusaders <1> should feel free to call meetings of the
Knighthood at their discretion.

You, Brother <n>, Have been consecrated and set apart as
a father over a numerous people.  Let you faith be a
tower of strength to those whom you diligently serve.

All my love <d>Brother <n> <1>,

Vangard Prophet of the <d>Holy Order <1>
