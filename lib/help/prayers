Syntax: [spells|prayers|rituals] [offensive|utility|targeted|nontargeted] [mage|cleric|shaman|deikhan] [unlearned]

The spells/prayers/rituals commands allow you to view your magic abilities by category.
The commands accept any combination of arguments in any order. If no category arguments
are passed it will default to displaying all categories.

The initiation commands (spells/prayers/rituals) are interchangeable and functionally identical,
unless no class arguments are passed. If no class arguments are included it will default to
displaying abilities based on the command used. Only abilities for classes your character
has will be displayed, whether or not that class is included in the arguments.

To see abilities you haven't yet learned but could in the future, add the "unlearned" argument.
This will also display any abilities unlocked through quests.

By default it will display the spell/prayer/ritual name and your current learnedness in the spell.
If applicable it will also display your maximum potential learnedness, and/or the component required
to cast the spell along with the number of charges available in all possible component storage
locations.

Usage examples:

spells utility targeted mage shaman unlearned
    -> Displays targeted utility spells for mage and shaman (if character has those classes),
       including unlearned

prayers
    -> Shows all cleric and deikhan prayers (if character has those classes), excluding unlearned

rituals cleric mage offensive
    -> Somewhat unintuitively, displays all targeted and non-targeted offensive abilities known
       to the character and available to a cleric or mage (if character has those classes)
