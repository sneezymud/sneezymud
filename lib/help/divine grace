While the deities provide their clerics with the ability to cause great 
afflictions apon their foes, to the deikhan they provide the ability to
resist many of these maladies so they may face down the most fearsome 
clerical servants of their deities enemies. It is known that some 
protection is provided to the deikhan against fear, paralysis, charm, 
summon, disease, bleeding and even flame.
