One of the first maneuvers taught to aspiring warriors, the slam attack
is a simple yet effective strike that prioritizes speed over raw power.
While far from the flashiest combat technique, the slam provides warriors
with a consistent attack with a fast recovery time.  As such, this attack
has become the foundational in the attack styles of many warriors.


Technical description: Slam is a consistent source of additional damage with
a fairly low cost and is intended to be used in-between other abilities 
that have lockouts.  In addition to the base skill damage, the damage a 
slam caused may be adjusted based on the enemies' maximum hit points or the 
warrior's level, allowing the skill to be used effecitively at all levels.
