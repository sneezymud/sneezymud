A skilled defender can develop the ability to withstand blows with more
tenacity. When struck in combat the combatant can "proc" toughness which
offers a small amount of protection from non-magical attacks. This affect
lasts a very short time but each proc will reset the timer and add an
additional stack of toughness. Toughness can stack up to twelve times.
