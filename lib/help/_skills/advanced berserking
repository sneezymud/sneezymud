While the average berserker represents a threat (albeit a one-dimensional one), 
a handful of Berserker tribes have truly mastered the art.  These advanced berserkers
maintain all the reckless abandon of a typical berserker but with even further
heightened combat prowess.  In particular, these skilled berserkers can increase the 
intensity of their bloodlust simply by fighting and can work themselves into a frenzy
over the course of a long battle.
