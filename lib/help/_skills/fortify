Through rigorous training, warriors have learned to fortify their defenses
by employing a shield wall maneuver.  While this technique renders the 
warrior nigh invulnerable, it can only be maintained for a short period of
time.  This maneuver is draining on the warrior and can only be attempted 
periodically.


Technical description: Fortify provides a very large damage-reduction against 
all sources of damage but for a very short amount of time.
