Deathstroke is a single, very destructive fighting move designed to
strike a victim's vital organs.  While the move can be attempted against healthy
foes, it is most effective against wounded opponents.  Deathstroke is generally
a risky maneuver and warriors should exercise caution when attempting this move.
Due to the overly aggressive nature of a deathstroke, warriors who attempt this 
maneuver tend to leave themselves exposed to attack for some time, and may even 
leave themselves open to a counter-attack to their own vital organs.  However, 
successfully landing this maneuver has been known to motivate warriors to fight 
with additional fervor.  

Deathstroke is a physical attack, and as such, requires the warrior be able to
successfully hit the victim.  Failure to do so will cause the attempt to fail.


Technical description: Deathstroke damage scales up as the victim's hp % decreases.
Deathstroke will always apply an armor penalty to the user so tanks should use it
sparingly, if at all.  Successful hits will also provide the user with +3 hitroll.
