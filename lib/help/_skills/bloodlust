Bloodlust represents a warrior's love of battle and their desire to
continue the fight.  With each foe vanquished, the warrior's bloodlust
continues to grow, increasing their effectiveness in battle.  Moreover,
the accompanying adrenaline rush can allow the warrior to continue to 
fight and sustain themselves, well beyond the stamina and vitality of
the average adventurer.  However, this fervor of battle can fade as quickly
as it comes on once a battle has ended.

Rumor has it that some tribes of northern Berskerers have further mastered
their lust for battle, allowing them to work themselves up into a bloodlust
even before vanquishing their foes.


Technical description: Bloodlust can stack up to 10 times.  Each stack provides
a regen boost (similar to enliven), with 10 stacks being a little over half as
strong as the enliven spell.  Each stack also provides +1 damroll to the warrior,
up to a maximum of +10 damroll.
