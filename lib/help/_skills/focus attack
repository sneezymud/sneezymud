Through their mastery of armed combat, warriors are able to study their
opponent's defense and find openings in even the most skilled defense.  
However, such focus is difficult for warriors to maintain, and thus a 
focused attack can only be attempted periodically.


Technical description: Focused attack does not do anything immediately
upon a successful use, but applies a buff to the warrior that has a 
chance to fire off a special attack in subsequent rounds of combat 
(consuming the buff when it does).  This buff is separate from the
lockout buff.  The special attack, when fired, is a normal melee hit with
the character's primary weapon but with a very high chance of success, even
against very difficult opponents.
