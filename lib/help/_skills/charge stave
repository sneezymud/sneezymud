Syntax: recharge <spell>

  With a greater understanding of a spell, a lot of the component and an
applicable staff it is possible for a mage to charge the various staves of The
World with power.  This is usually limited to what the stave was originally
used for but there are ones out there that are raw and unrefined.  But the
cost of such a feat is quite draining on the mage and could drain all of the
mana from their body.  Be forewarned that this ability is held only by those
who master the arts of the magic they wish to charge.

  Since the arts of staffs and wands are so chancy only certain objects have
been mastered.  At current only those objects that are Staffs, not wands, may
be charged.  And you must be holding the staff you wish to charge.  When
recharging an older staff simply execute charge.
