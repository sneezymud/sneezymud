Putting oneself in harms way to save another is a most noble action as to even
help the Deikhan earn favor with the Deities. Guardians that know divine rescue
will call upon the Deities to bestow a blessing upon the victim who is rescued.
This skill is executed passively whenever the Deikhan attempts to use rescue.
