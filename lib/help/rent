Syntax: rent
Syntax: rent credit

For use in the receptions of inns, in homes or after having successfully
encamped.  The rent command will store your items and make you leave the 
game.  The next time you enter, you will start out in the room where you 
left.  

This is the recommended way of leaving the game. Simply dropping link
is risky as it may leave you vulnerable to item or experience point loss. 

Renting will also keep track of any NPC followers. Such pets, thralls 
or charms will be available to you when you next log in.  No guarantees 
are made regarding NPC storage and no reimbursement of any form will be
made for them.

We cannot guarantee storage of items on characters rented for over three
months.
