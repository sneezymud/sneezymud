A very devout deikhan may invoke the deities to directly intervene against
the deikhan's foes, smiting the opponent and causing it to suffer greatly.
The deikhan must channel the intervention through the deikhan's Weapon of
Power, so the loss of such a weapon will prevent any smiting.  The power
of the smite is dependent upon how devout the deikhan has been and how well
the opponent's own deities care to protect it. Smiting leaves the deikhan 
full of vengeful energy for a short time and while this can aid in attacking 
her foes, it leaves the deikhan much less able to defend herself. Smiting 
may only be done several times per day based on level.
